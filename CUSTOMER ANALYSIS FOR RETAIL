ANALYTICS IN RETAIL:
With the retail market getting more and more competitive by the day, there has never been
anything more important than the ability for optimizing service business processes when
trying to satisfy the expectations of customers. Channelizing and managing data with the
aim of working in favor of the customer as well as generating profits is very significant for
survival.
Ideally, a retailer’s customer data reflects the company’s success in reaching and nurturing
its customers. Retailers built reports summarizing customer behavior using metrics such as
conversion rate, average order value, recency of purchase and total amount spent in recent
transactions. These measurements provided general insight into the behavioral tendencies
of customers.
Customer intelligence is the practice of determining and delivering data-driven insights into
past and predicted future customer behavior.To be effective, customer intelligence must
combine raw transactional and behavioral data to generate derived measures.
In a nutshell, for big retail players all over the world, data analytics is applied more these
days at all stages of the retail process – taking track of popular products that are emerging,
doing forecasts of sales and future demand via predictive simulation, optimizing placements
of products and offers through heat-mapping of customers and many others.
